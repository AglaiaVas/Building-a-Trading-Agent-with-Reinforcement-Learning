# Building-a-Trading-Agent-with-Reinforcement-Learning
This project is about developing a trading agent using Double Deep Q-Network (DDQN) reinforcement learning. The goal is to create a model that learns from stock market data and suggests whether to "buy," "sell," or "hold" to maximize cumulative returns. The model learns from daily historical data of the SNP 500 index.
