The agent selects actions (buy, sell, hold) based on market data and seeks to maximize cumulative rewards. DDQN helps reduce **overestimation bias** by using two networks: the **online network** for selecting actions and the **target network** for evaluating them.\n","\n","---\n","\n","### Key Concepts in the Code\n","\n","1. **Q-Learning**:  \n","   The agent learns to maximize cumulative rewards by updating Q-values for state-action pairs. The Q-value update follows the **Bellman Equation**:\n","\n","   $$\n","   Q(s, a) \\leftarrow Q(s, a) + \\alpha \\left( r + \\gamma \\max_{a'} Q(s', a') - Q(s, a) \\right)\n","   $$\n","\n","   Where:\n","   - $Q(s, a)$: Q-value for action $a$ in state $s$\n","   - $\\alpha$: Learning rate\n","   - $r$: Reward for action $a$\n","   - $\\gamma$: Discount factor for future rewards\n","   - $s'$: The next state\n","   - $\\max_{a'} Q(s', a')$: Maximum Q-value for the next state\n","\n","2. **Double DQN**:  \n","   The code uses two networks to decouple action selection and evaluation:\n","   - **Online Network** ($Q_{\\text{online}}(s, a)$): Used to select the action with the highest Q-value.\n","   - **Target Network** ($Q_{\\text{target}}(s, a)$): Used to evaluate the value of the chosen action.\n","\n","   The DDQN update rule is:\n","\n","   $$\n","   Q_{\\text{online}}(s, a) \\leftarrow Q_{\\text{online}}(s, a) + \\alpha \\left( r + \\gamma Q_{\\text{target}}(s', \\arg\\max_{a'} Q_{\\text{online}}(s', a')) - Q_{\\text{online}}(s, a) \\right)\n","   $$\n","\n","   This reduces overestimation by separating the action selection (via the online network) from value evaluation (via the target network).\n","\n","3. **Experience Replay**:  \n","   The agent stores experiences $(s, a, r, s')$ in a replay buffer. During training, random mini-batches are sampled from the buffer to break correlations between consecutive experiences, improving learning stability.\n","\n","4. **Epsilon-Greedy Policy**:  \n","   The agent balances exploration and exploitation using an **epsilon-greedy policy**. With probability $\\epsilon$, a random action is chosen (exploration). With probability $1 - \\epsilon$, the agent selects the action with the highest Q-value (exploitation):\n","\n","   $$\n","   \\pi(a|s) =\n","   \\begin{cases}\n","   \\text{random action} & \\text{with probability } \\epsilon \\\\\n","   \\arg\\max_a Q_{\\text{online}}(s, a) & \\text{with probability } 1 - \\epsilon\n","   \\end{cases}\n","   $$\n","\n","   The epsilon value decays over time, gradually reducing exploration.\n","\n","5. **Target Network Update**:  \n","   Periodically, the target network is updated by copying the weights from the online network:\n","\n","   $$\n","   Q_{\\text{target}}(s, a) \\leftarrow Q_{\\text{online}}(s, a)\n","   $$\n","\n","   This keeps the target network stable, which helps prevent oscillations during training.\n","\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"f5-_vocc8kbb"},"id":"f5-_vocc8kbb"},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":71,"id":"JuEKmn4_F-bJ","metadata":{"executionInfo":{"elapsed":9,"status":"ok","timestamp":1728242308081,"user":{"displayName":"Aglaia Vasileiou","userId":"07251251541452201680"},"user_tz":-60},"id":"JuEKmn4_F-bJ"},"outputs":[],"source":["import talib"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":72,"id":"8429a06f-978d-4760-87e9-35b866fa92b8","metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"elapsed":1527,"status":"ok","timestamp":1728242309600,"user":{"displayName":"Aglaia Vasileiou","userId":"07251251541452201680"},"user_tz":-60},"id":"8429a06f-978d-4760-87e9-35b866fa92b8","outputId":"27b3dc5a-eae8-42f5-8192-a536df9d145b"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Drive already mounted at /content/drive; to attempt to forcibly remount, call drive.mount(\"/content/drive\", force_remount=True).\n","Current Working Directory: /content/drive/My Drive/Colab Notebooks/Project\n"]}],"source":["from google.colab import drive\n","import os\n","\n","# Mount Google Drive\n","drive.mount('/content/drive')\n","\n","# Change directory to the equivalent of G:\\My Drive\\Colab Notebooks\\Project\n","os.chdir('/content/drive/My Drive/Colab Notebooks/Project')\n","\n","# Verify the current working directory\n","print(\"Current Working Directory:\", os.getcwd())\n","\n","# Now you can access your .py files within this folder\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":73,"id":"d8b7aef2-c851-43f1-87e8-770d3882a9c0","metadata":{"executionInfo":{"elapsed":13,"status":"ok","timestamp":1728242309600,"user":{"displayName":"Aglaia Vasileiou","userId":"07251251541452201680"},"user_tz":-60},"id":"d8b7aef2-c851-43f1-87e8-770d3882a9c0"},"outputs":[],"source":["import warnings\n","warnings.filterwarnings('ignore')"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":74,"id":"4de2a1ce-0716-4381-9afa-1fa126a323d7","metadata":{"executionInfo":{"elapsed":12,"status":"ok","timestamp":1728242309600,"user":{"displayName":"Aglaia Vasileiou","userId":"07251251541452201680"},"user_tz":-60},"id":"4de2a1ce-0716-4381-9afa-1fa126a323d7"},"outputs":[],"source":["%matplotlib inline\n","from pathlib import Path\n","from time import time\n","from collections import deque\n","from random import sample\n","\n","\n","import numpy as np\n","import pandas as pd\n","\n","import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n","from matplotlib.ticker import FuncFormatter\n","import seaborn as sns\n","\n","import torch\n","import torch.nn as nn\n","import torch.optim as optim\n","import gym\n","from gym.envs.registration import register\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":75,"id":"40c10382-0946-4f4d-9736-929e126b45de","metadata":{"executionInfo":{"elapsed":12,"status":"ok","timestamp":1728242309600,"user":{"displayName":"Aglaia Vasileiou","userId":"07251251541452201680"},"user_tz":-60},"id":"40c10382-0946-4f4d-9736-929e126b45de"},"outputs":[],"source":["# Set NumPy random seed\n","np.random.seed(42)\n","\n","# Set PyTorch random seed\n","torch.manual_seed(42)\n","\n","# If you are using CUDA (GPU) as well, you should also set the seed for all GPUs\n","if torch.cuda.is_available():\n","    torch.cuda.manual_seed(42)\n","    torch.cuda.manual_seed_all(42)  #

reinforcement learning. The agent interacts with a trading environment, aiming to maximize cumulative rewards by choosing actions (e.g., buy, sell, hold) based on the market state.\n","\n","### Key Components:\n","1. **Online Network**: This neural network selects actions by estimating Q-values for each state-action pair. The network is trained to predict future rewards based on current observations.\n","\n","2. **Target Network**: A separate network used for action evaluation. It is updated periodically with the weights from the online network. By decoupling action selection from evaluation, DDQN reduces the overestimation bias inherent in standard DQN.\n","\n","3. **Experience Replay**: The agent stores experiences (state, action, reward, next state) in a replay buffer. During training, random samples (mini-batches) from the buffer are used to break the correlation between consecutive experiences, leading to more stable learning.\n","\n","4. **Epsilon-Greedy Policy**: The agent uses an epsilon-greedy policy to balance exploration and exploitation. It chooses a random action with probability $\\epsilon$ and the action with the highest Q-value with probability $1 - \\epsilon$. Epsilon decays over time, reducing exploration as the agent learns.\n","\n","5. **Training**: The agent is trained using mini-batch gradient descent. The loss is the difference between the predicted Q-values from the online network and the target Q-values, computed using the target network. The loss is minimized to improve the Q-value estimations over time.\n"],"metadata":{"id":"sJi-dKqm95WR"},"id":"sJi-dKqm95WR"},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":86,"id":"36106286-7f78-417d-8d09-6ca80bce232d","metadata":{"executionInfo":{"elapsed":3,"status":"ok","timestamp":1728242310590,"user":{"displayName":"Aglaia Vasileiou","userId":"07251251541452201680"},"user_tz":-60},"id":"36106286-7f78-417d-8d09-6ca80bce232d"},"outputs":[],"source":["import torch\n","import torch.nn as nn\n","import torch.optim as optim\n","import random\n","import numpy as np\n","from collections import deque\n","import logging\n","\n","# Set up logging configuration\n","logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)\n","\n","class DDQNAgent:\n","    def __init__(self, state_dim,\n","                 num_actions,\n","                 learning_rate,\n","                 gamma,\n","                 epsilon_start,\n","                 epsilon_end,\n","                 epsilon_decay_steps,\n","                 epsilon_exponential_decay,\n","                 replay_capacity,\n","                 architecture,\n","                 l2_reg,\n","                 tau,\n","                 batch_size):\n","        #
